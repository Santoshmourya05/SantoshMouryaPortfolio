      <h2>More About Me</h2>
      <p>
      During my internship at CSIR NIO Goa, I gained practical knowledge and contributed to creative research efforts. I also interned at SparkPlus Technology, where I learned Reactjs and refined my front-end development skills. I enjoy designing visually beautiful and interactive interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. I also have an understanding of analytical tools such as Excel and PowerBI.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have excellent leadership abilities, adept problem-solving skills, effective time management capabilities, a strong team player mindset, and a genuine passion for continuous learning.
